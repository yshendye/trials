  <h1>How to manage a Queue</h1>
  <p><em>With social distancing becoming new normal, <strong><a href="Profile.html" target="_blank">managing multiple customer would be a challenge.</a></strong></em></p>
  <p><em>
      Hence you would need a system using which you can manage your customers in a way that <strong> they don't have to wait for their turn </strong>to come and get unhappy and go to your competition.
    </em></p>
  <p><em>
      Hence, <strong> a virtual queue is the key</strong>. This software allow you to manage the virtual queue <strong>without your client/customer installing any unnecessary app </strong> on the mobile. Just share a link and they will be able to see
      when their turn is coming.
    </em></p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Populate the list of Services that you offer (Download the Excel Format for your reference)
    </li>
    <li>
      Each item in your list must have a time required to complete the task (so that people know the approximate time of their turn)
    </li>
    <li>
      Enter the Shop Opening and Closing time (and also the days on which your shop operates). Also mention the lunchtime, if any.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Bingo!!! That's it. <strong>You are ready to roll.</strong></em>
    </li>
  </ol>

    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enter the details of the services performed by the different set of people, so that the calculations of the time would be even more robust.

      <li>
        Booking after cancellation. While a lot of people would be making the bookings and some may want your service urgently. In such case the customer can opt for getting the booking earlier than the available booking, if there is any slot
        available
        if someone cancells the appointment.
